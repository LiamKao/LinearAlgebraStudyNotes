# Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces
## 2.B Bases



#### 2.27 Definition basis
A basis of $V$ is a list of vectors in $V$ that is linearly independent and spans $V$.


#### 2.29 Criterion for basis
A list $v_1,...,v_m$ of vectors in $V$ is a basis of $V$ if and only if every $v \in V$ can be written uniquely in the form
$$ v = a_1v_1+...+a_nv_n \qquad 2.30  $$
$where \; a_1,...,a_n \in \mathbf{F}$.


#### 2.31 Spanning list contains a basis
Every spanning list in a vector space can be reduced to a basis of the vector space.


#### 2.32 Basis of finite-dimensional vector space
Every finite-dimensional vector space has a basis.


#### 2.33 Linearly independent list extends to a basis
Every linearly independent list of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space can be extended to a basis of the vector space.

#### 2.34 Every subspace of $V$ is part of a direct sum equal to $V$
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Then there is a
subspace $W$ of $V$ such that $V =U \oplus W$
