# Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces

## 2.C Dimension

#### 2.35 Basis length does not depend on basis
Any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same length.

#### 2.36 Definition ***dimension***, dim V
- The ***dimension*** of a finite-dimensional vector space is the length of
any basis of the vector space.
- The dimension of $\mathbf{V}$ (if $\mathbf{V}$ is finite-dimensional) is denoted by $dim\mathbf{V}$.

#### 2.38 Dimension of a subspace
If $\mathbf{V}$ is finite-dimensional and $\mathbf{U}$ is a subspace of $\mathbf{V}$, then $dim \mathbf{U}$ $\leq$ $dim \mathbf{V}$

#### 2.39 Linearly independent list of the right length is a basis
Suppose $\mathbf{V}$ is finite-dimensional. Then every linearly independent list of vectors in $\mathbf{V}$ with length $dim \mathbf{V}$ is a basis of $\mathbf{V}$.

#### 2.42 Spanning list of the right length is a basis
Suppose $\mathbf{V}$ is finite-dimensional. Then every spanning list of vectors in $\mathbf{V}$
with length $dim \mathbf{V}$ is a basis of $\mathbf{V}$.

#### 2.43 Dimension of a sum
If $\mathbf{U_1}$ and $\mathbf{U_2}$ are subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space, then
$$dim( \mathbf{U_1} +\mathbf{U_2}) =  dim\mathbf{U_1} + dim \mathbf{U_2} - dim( \mathbf{U_1} \cap \mathbf{U_2} )$$
