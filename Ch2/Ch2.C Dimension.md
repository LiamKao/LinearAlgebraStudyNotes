# Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces

## 2.C Dimension

#### 2.35 Basis length does not depend on basis
Any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same length.

#### 2.36 Definition ***dimension***, dim V
- The ***dimension*** of a finite-dimensional vector space is the length of
any basis of the vector space.
- The dimension of $V$ (if $V$ is finite-dimensional) is denoted by $dimV$.

#### 2.38 Dimension of a subspace
If $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V$, then $dim U$ $\leq$ $dim V$

#### 2.39 Linearly independent list of the right length is a basis
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then every linearly independent list of vectors in $V$ with length $dim V$ is a basis of $V$.

#### 2.42 Spanning list of the right length is a basis
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then every spanning list of vectors in $V$
with length $dim V$ is a basis of $V$.

#### 2.43 Dimension of a sum
If $U_1$ and $U_2$ are subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space, then
$$dim( U_1 +U_2) =  dimU_1 + dim U_2 - dim( U_1 \cap U_2 )$$
