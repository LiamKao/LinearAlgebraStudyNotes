### Representing a Linear Map by a Matrix

#### 3.30 Definition matrix, $A_{j,k}$
Let $m$ and $n$ denote positive integers. An $m$-by-$n$ matrix $A$ is a rectangular array of elements of $\mathbf{F}$ with m rows and n columns:

$$
A =
 \begin{pmatrix}
   A_{1,1} & & ... & & A_{1,n}\\
   \vdots  & &  & & \vdots \\
   A_{m,1} & & ... & & A_{m,n}
  \end{pmatrix}
$$

The notation $A_{j,k}$ denotes the entry in row $j$ , column $k$ of $A$. In other
words, the first index refers to the row number and the second index refers
to the column number.

#### 3.32 Definition matrix of a linear map, $\mathcal{M}(T)$
Suppose $T\in\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ and $v_1,\dots,v_n$ is a basis of $V$ and $w_1,\dots,w_m$ is a basis of $W$. The ***matrix of*** $T$ with respect to these bases is the $m$-by-$n$ matrix $\mathcal{M}(T)$ whose entries $A_{jk,}$ are defined by
$$Tv_{k}=A_{1,k}w_1+\dots+A_{m,k}w_m$$
If the bases are not clear from the context, then the notation $\mathcal{M}(T,v_1,\dots,v_n,w_1,\dots,w_m)$ is used.

### Addition and Scalar Multiplication of Matrices

####3.35 Definition matrix addition
The sum of two matrices of the same size is the matrix obtained by adding
corresponding entries in the matrices:


$$
 \begin{pmatrix}
   A_{1,1} & & ... & & A_{1,n}\\
   \vdots  & &  & & \vdots \\
   A_{m,1} & & ... & & A_{m,n}
  \end{pmatrix}+
  \begin{pmatrix}
    C_{1,1} & & ... & & C_{1,n}\\
    \vdots  & &  & & \vdots \\
    C_{m,1} & & ... & & C_{m,n}
   \end{pmatrix}=
   \begin{pmatrix}
     A_{1,1}+C_{1,1} & & ... & & A_{1,n}+C_{1,n}\\
     \vdots  & &  & & \vdots \\
     A_{m,1}+C_{m,1} & & ... & & A_{m,n}+C_{m,n}
    \end{pmatrix}
$$


In other words, ($A+C)_{j,k} = A_{j,k}+C_{j,k}$

#### 3.36 The matrix of the sum of linear maps
Suppose $ S,T\in\mathcal{L}(V,W) . $ then $   \mathcal{M}(S+T) = \mathcal{M}(S) + \mathcal{M}(T)$

#### 3.37 Definition scalar multiplication of a matrix
The product of a scalar and a matrix is the matrix obtained by multiplying
each entry in the matrix by the scalar:

$$\lambda
 \begin{pmatrix}
   A_{1,1} & & ... & & A_{1,n}\\
   \vdots  & &  & & \vdots \\
   A_{m,1} & & ... & & A_{m,n}
  \end{pmatrix}=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \lambda A_{1,1} & & ... & & \lambda A_{1,n}\\
    \vdots  & &  & & \vdots \\
    \lambda A_{m,1} & & ... & & \lambda A_{m,n}
   \end{pmatrix}
$$

In other words, $(\lambda A)_{j,k} = \lambda A_{j,k}$

#### 3.38 The matrix of a scalar times a linear map
Suppose $ \lambda \in \mathbf{F} $ and $ T\in\mathcal{L}(V,W) . $ then $   \mathcal{M}( \lambda T) = \lambda \mathcal{M}(T)$

#### 3.39 Notation $\mathbf{F}^{m,n}$
For $m$ and $n$ positive integers, the set of all $m$-by-$n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbf{F}$ is denoted by $\mathbf{F}^{m,n}$.

#### 3.40 $dim \mathbf{F}^{m,n} = mn$
Suppose $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. With addition and scalar multiplication defined as above, $\mathbf{F}^{m,n}$ is a vector space with dimension $mn$.


### Matrix Multiplication

#### 3.41 Definition matrix multiplication
Suppose $A$ is an $m$-by-$n$ matrix and $C$ is an $n$-by-$p$ matrix. Then $AC$ is
defined to be the $m$-by-$p$ matrix whose entry in row $j$ , column $k$, is given
by the following equation:

$$ (AC)_{j,k} = \sum_{r=1}^{n} A_{j,r} C_{r,k} $$

In other words, the entry in row $j$ , column $k$, of $AC$ is computed by
taking row $j$ of $A$ and column $k$ of $C$ , multiplying together corresponding
entries, and then summing.


#### 3.44 Notation $A_{j, \cdot } , A_{\cdot,k}$
Suppose $A$ is an $m$-by-$n$ matrix.
- If $1\leq j \leq m$, then $A_{j, \cdot }$ denotes the $1$-by-$n$ matrix consisting of row $j$ of $A$.
- If $1\leq j \leq k$, then $A_{\cdot, k}$ denotes the $m$-by-$1$ matrix consisting of column $k$ of $A$.
